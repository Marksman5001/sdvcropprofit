            Welcome to Stardew Crop Info! This site aims to address a problem I personally have encountered quite a bit. I cannot find any 
            for sure, 100% up-to-date information on which crops are best for each season. So I thought "Why not just make it?"
            Gotta choose something for the school project, right? This site will contain all the basic statistics for crops in the three 
            major seasons of the game, including g and experience per day. Ya know, just in case you need to calculate the number of kale 
            you need to hit farming 6 before summer starts.
        </p>
        <img class="kale" src="./images/Kale.jpg" alt="kale">
        <p>This site has a lovely page for each of the (important) seasons in Stardew! Each page should provide you with enough information
            to make your own decisions about which crop to grow, or just find out which one is the best. Remember, there's no wrong crop to plant!
        </p>
        <p>
            (Quick disclamer, not all of the math or statistics listed here are 100% accurate, but they are close enough that they represent
            significant data. A few of the g/day stats might be a little off, but for the most part, the conclusions are the same. The major reason for
            inaccuracy is that some crops have a small chance for extras that seems to be different for each crop, and I couldn't 
            find information on them. So if you're unlucky like me these numbers are basically 100% accurate too! It also assumes
            that crops are planted for maximum efficacy, such as rice being planted next to water, or strawberries being grown all season.)
